//---------------------------------------- ABOUT ----------------------------------------//
Masai is a 2D platform game based on Masai folklore. It uses the LÖVE 2D engine.
To play it, you'll need to install LÖVE from http://love2d.org/

It's still a WIP and many things will change in the future, whenever that might be. ^^;
